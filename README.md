# The Game

The Game is a drawing/guessing game in which a group of players take turns drawing a term or phrase and guessing what the previous player drew. Traditionally, the game was played with paper scraps, but this repository houses the code for an online, mobile-friendly version of the game.

## Original Rules

1. Each player must start with a stack of paper scraps containing one scrap for each player in the game (eg, if there were 7 players, each player would need a stack of 7 paper scraps.)
2. Each player writes down a term or phrase, and when all players are done, everyone passes their stack counter-clockwise.
3. Each player reads the term of phrase written by the previous player, moves the scrap with the term/phrase to the bottom of the stack, and draws an interpretation on the scrap at the top of the stack. When all players are done, everyone passes their stack counter-clockwise.
4. Each playe looks at the illustration drawn by the previous player, moves the scrap with the illustration to the bottom of the stack, and writes a guess of the original term/phrase on the scrap at the top of the stack. When all players are done, everyone passes their stack counter-clockwise.
5. This pattern continues until each player is passed their original stack.
6. Each player presents the evolution of their stack.
